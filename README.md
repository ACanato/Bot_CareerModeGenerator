# Discord Bot - Career Mode Idea Generator (FIFA & FOOTBALL MANAGER)

This is a Discord bot that generates career mode ideas/challenges.

---

## Features

- When the `!generate` command is used, the bot sends a message with two reaction options:  
  ‚öΩÔ∏è EA FC (FIFA)  
  üíª Football Manager (FM)

- By reacting to that message with one of the options, the bot deletes the original message and sends a new message with a random idea related to the chosen game.

---

## How it works

1. **`!generate` command**  
   Sends a message with reaction options (‚öΩÔ∏è and üíª) for the user to choose the type of game idea they want to receive.

2. **Reaction to the bot**  
   When a reaction is clicked, the bot identifies which reaction it was, deletes the original message, and sends a new message with a random idea for the respective game.

3. **Idea lists**  
   The bot has two predefined lists of ideas:  
   - `ideias_fifa`: challenges and scenarios for EA FC (FIFA)  
   - `ideias_fm`: challenges and scenarios for Football Manager
